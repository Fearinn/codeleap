This project was created as part of CodeLeap's recruitment process. It's similar to a simple social media, with CRUD actions.

## ü™Ñ Features

- CRUD actions;
- Login with sessionStorage;
- Relative format for time since post creation, with updates every minute;
- Modals with animation and focus control;
- Success and error messages after API calls.

## :hammer: Possible improvements 

If I could put more time and effort on this project, I would try to:

- Add dark theme;
- Set interval to automatically update timeline;
- Add custom messages for each failed or succesfull action;
- Add possibility to mute/block other users;
- Add profile pages;
- Add real login/logout, with password and JWT.
